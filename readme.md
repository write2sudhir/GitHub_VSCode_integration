# Hi there, this is my first try to push repo to GitHub from VSCode

# I refereed below link to achieve the same 
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46877667/how-to-add-a-new-project-to-github-using-vs-code

# Steps I followed are as below 
<!-- 
Launch the command palette Ctrl+Shift+P, run Publish to Github, and follow the prompt. 
You will be given the choice between a private and public repository, so be careful that you choose the right one.

 When you are done it should give you a popup notification in the bottom right with a link to the repo https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>

Minor warning: if your project already has a .gitignore file in it this process will overwrite it -->


# used git commit -a -m "msg" to commit changes done after initial push
